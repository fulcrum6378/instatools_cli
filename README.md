# InstaTools

An interactive command-line interface for:

1. Downloading bulk content from Instagram in desired qualities (using the parameter `--quality=?`):
    - `d`|`download`: direct links to posts or reels
    - `s`|`saved`: saved posts (+the ability to unsave them)
    - `p`|`posts`: posts of a profile
    - `t`|`tagged`: tagged posts of a profile
    - `r`|`story`: story of a profile
    - `h`|`highlight`: highlights of a profile
2. Exporting direct messages in HTML, TXT and JSON file formats: `m`|`messages`
3. Retrieving information about a user including their high-quality profile picture: `u`|`user`

This application is the successor of its Android version which was developed and published in 2022
on Google Play and Galaxy Store and was banned because of copyright infringement against the trademark of Instagram!

I also wanted to rewrite this project in Java, but was bored so quickly by the boilerplate I had to write in Java!
Other JVM-based languages are weird! Kotlin is the best!
